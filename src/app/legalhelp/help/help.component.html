    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part
    of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users
    manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
    business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
    availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

          <h2>Exploring the Board</h2>
          When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
          contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

          <h2>Creating Contacts</h2>
          In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
          click
          on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
          assigned
          tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

          <h2>Adding Cards</h2>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
          tasks.
          Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
          in
          the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

          <h2>Moving Cards</h2>
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
          dropping the card from one list to another.
